# rockpaperscissor
basic rock paper scissors game (first independent python project)

Roughly a Month After my inital commit, I learned more about python and wrote the 'rockpaperscissorsGUI.py' file to this repo to display my learning of tkinter and GUI development. The GUI version is less reliable than the CLI version which I intend to fix as time goes on, I just didn't want to repos for essential the same project.
